naming server module will register the other three modules as 3 applications
api-gateway will help to make connection of currency-exchange service and currency-conversion service.

dummy values are already stored in sql file in currency-exchange service 

1st -> install docker

2nd -> docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin //run this command in command prompt

3rd -> open all those modules in eclipse

4th -> run each module as maven build and write spring-boot: build-image -DskipsTest in goals box.

5th -> go to the directory where docker-compose file is placed

6th -> run command propmt or git bash there

7th -> check your docker is running then write command docker-compose up

8th -> it will take few seconds then go to http://localhost:9411. 

you will see that how your apis are working and which module calls which one.

you can also run your APIs individually...

APIs are as follow:-

currency-exchange:
http://localhost:8000/currencyExchange/from/USD/to/PKR

currency-conversion:
http://localhost:8100/currencyConversion-feign/from/LEI/to/PKR/quantity/2.432

api gate-way:
http://localhost:8765/currencyExchange/from/USD/to/PKR

http://localhost:8765/currencyConversion-feign/from/LEI/to/PKR/quantity/20.432
